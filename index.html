<h2>song lyrics</h2>

    <p>Georgia, wrap me up in all your</p>
    <p>I want you in my arms</p>
    <p>Oh, let me hold you</p>
<p>I'll never let you go again like I did</p>

<p>Oh, I used to say</p>
<p>I would never fall in love again until I found her</p>
<p>I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"</p>
<p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>

<p>I found you</p>
<p>Georgia, pulled me in, I asked to</p>
<p>Love her once again</p>
<p>You fell, I caught you</p>

<p>I'll never let you go again like I did</p>
<p>Oh, I used to say</p>
<p>I would never fall in love again until I found her</p>
<p>I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"</p>

<p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>
<p>I found you</p>
<p>I would never fall in love again until I found her</p>
<p>I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"</p>

<p>I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her</p>
<p>I found you</p>
